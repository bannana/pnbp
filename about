pnbp - pnbp is not a blogging platform (p = python).

pnbp is a static content manager that does things with configurability and obscurity.

pnbp should NOT:

 - suggest the way things should be done

 - not be able to do something purely because it can't be configured to do so

pnbp should DO:

 - easy API for generator - widget interactions

 - report issues in compiling site with clear, concise results.

pnbp flow of compiling:

compile.py -> reads config.json -> iterate through pages -> generates page template -> run pagevar

compiled pages in .data in pages directory, along with index.php and subpages.conf
